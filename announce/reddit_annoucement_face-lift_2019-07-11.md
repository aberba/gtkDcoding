The gtkDcoding Face-lift is Now "Complete"

Yeah, I noticed those quotes, too. One may ask if any website (or anything else, really) is ever truly finished or just abandoned. All I can say is that these changes were made to [https://gtkdcoding.com](the gtkDcoding website) over the last two weeks in three phases:

- posts are now color coded by topic,
- each topic has an associated road-sign avatar,
- each code example has a screenshot composite with:
	- shot(s) of the running example,
	- shot of the terminal showing the example's output, and
	-  a link to the example source (which pops up in a new tab/window when clicked),
-  syntax highlighting for all code quoted in the post, and
-  a secondary 'landing' page where all blog posts are listed by subject.

The primary reasons for all this are:

- to make specific examples easier to find, and
- allow people to read everything on a topic without having to skip around.

gtkDcoding has been up-and-running for more than six months now and has a total of 54 posts, the lion's share of which cover building cross-platform UI elements with GtkD, the D-language port of GTK.

All examples are compliant with GTK 3.2.4 or later.
