# gtkDcoding README
GtkD is GTK+ for use with the D programming language. It's used to build GUI's for desktop applications and works on a number of POSIX operating systems (read: UNIX, UNIX-like, and OSX) as well as Windows. It and the D language itself can therefore be used to build cross-platform desktop applications in a write-once-compile-for-many process.

My goal is to help bring in a new and larger audience for D and GtkD and to introduce code to coders (and vice versa) in the most pain-free way possible. When I started looking at GtkD, a lot of code examples covered how to use a few basic widgets in very basic ways. Other examples demonstrated multiple widgets all at once, which meant separating what I wanted to know from what I wanted to learn later (or not at all) a bit of a brainteaser... not that picking what you want out of a code example is a bad thing, but it's time-consuming and I'm impatient.

The Dlang and GtkD forums have been great places to hang out, come into contact with others in the community, and find answers to questions. I'd like to thank everyone on those forums for all the help they've offered as I worked toward getting up to speed.

In the spirit of the community, and with a tip of the hat to Richard Stallman, all code contained in this blog is hereby offered to the public domain. I hope it serves the purpose for which it's intended, to help you get up and running in building your own applications with D and GtkD.

Although the text is copyrighted, I'm making it free to read and to use as a learning tool. If ever I compile these posts into book form, I'll revisit this whole copyright thing, but likely it'll end up being distributed for cheap or free through whichever distribution channels make the most sense at the time.

I hope to help make your journey into D, GtkD, and cross-platform development a little easier. If I've succeeded, please let me know in comments either here or on the gtkDcoding blog.
