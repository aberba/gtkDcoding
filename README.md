# gtkDcoding README
GtkD is GTK+ for use with the D programming language. It's used to build GUI's for desktop applications and works on a number of POSIX operating systems (read: UNIX, UNIX-like, and OSX) as well as Windows. It and the D language itself can therefore be used to build cross-platform desktop applications in a write-once-compile-for-many process.

The purpose of this blog is to introduce GtkD to a new audience in the most pain-free way possible. When I started looking at GtkD, most code examples covered how to use a few basic widgets in very basic ways. Other examples demonstrated multiple widgets all in the same code file, making it a brainteaser to separate what I wanted to know from what I wanted to learn later (or not at all)... not that picking what you want out of a code example is a bad thing, but it's time-consuming and I'm impatient.

The Dlang and GtkD forums have been great places to hang out, come into contact with others in the community, and get questions answered. I'd like to thank everyone on those forums for all the help they've offered as I worked toward getting up to speed.

This blog and the accompanying code examples are the culimation of research, asking questions, digging into the GtkD source and experimenting like a mad demon for months (maybe years, in the end.) All code is hereby offered to the public domain.

All text, both blog text and any works derived therefrom, is copyrighted by me, Ronald Vincent Tarrant. That said, you're welcome to read any and all blog posts at any time.

I hope to help make your journey into D, GtkD, and cross-platform development a little easier. If I've succeeded, please let me know in comments either here or on the gtkDcoding blog.
